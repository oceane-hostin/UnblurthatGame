Over the course of 5 rounds, collect the most points by trading, live stock farming, city building and scientific research to win!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Hundred Years? war is over and the Renaissance is looming. Conditions are perfect for the princes of the Loire Valley to propel their estates to prosperity and prominence. Through strategic trading and building, clever planning, and careful thought, players add settlements and castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, farm livestock, and more in this classic Stefan Feld Eurogame.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow to Play: 1. Players take turns rolling two dice and choosing to move goods tiles from the game board to their player boards; from their player boards onto corresponding numbered and colored regions of their playing fields; to deliver goods in exchange for silverlings; or to take worker tiles. 2. Play continues, with players completing additional actions and noting victory points for each tile placed. 3. Five turns are taken per round, with additional victory points awarded for unused money and workers, undelivered goods, and percentage of settlement complete. The player with the most victory points after five rounds wins the game.",

Sequential Order (Yellow): The player who adds this yellow tile to their estate is now always at the top in the sequential order lineup with their playing piece. This is the case whether actively or passively (even if another playing piece would get there and normally be on top.) Worker Tiles (Yellow): When a player adds this yellow tile to their estate, they can now purchase worker tiles from the general supply at any time. The cost is 1 silverling for 2 tiles."

All other rules regarding the black depot remain the same. \r\n As with other black-backed tiles, a cloister can be bought from the central black depot for 2 Silverlings, and is then placed onto an empty storage space in the bottom left-hand corner of the player’s board. \r\n This owned cloister can be placed onto an empty space in the player’s estate that is adjacent to at least one previously placed tile and that matches the number on the player’s die.  The cloister does not have a function after placement, but simply helps complete a region. \r\n Note: The size of a region increases by 1 for each cloister within it. However, a region containing one or more cloisters can never be greater than 8! \r\n Example: A 4-space region with 2 cloisters on it is considered a 6-space region, earning 21 victory points instead of only 10.
